Interviewer: Good morning! Thanks for coming in today. Let’s dive into the case. Imagine you’re advising a client who wants to enter the coffee shop market in a mid-sized city. How would you approach this?

Interviewee: Good morning! Uh, okay, so I’d start by, um, analyzing the market. I think first I’d look at the demand—how many people drink coffee in this city, you know? Then, I’d check the competition, like Starbucks or local shops, to see how saturated it is. Does that make sense?

Interviewer: Yes, that’s a good start. Can you walk me through your framework in more detail?

Interviewee: Sure. So, after demand and competition, I’d look at the supply side—like, where do we get coffee beans, and what’s the cost? Oh, and location—finding a spot with good foot traffic. I’d also think about pricing, maybe a bit lower than competitors to attract customers initially. Uh, let me see… yeah, and marketing, like social media ads or loyalty programs. Is there anything specific you’d want me to focus on?

Interviewer: Let’s zoom in on the competition. How would you assess it quantitatively?

Interviewee: Right, um, quantitatively… I’d estimate the number of coffee shops in the city—say, there’s 20—and look at their revenue. Maybe use public data or industry reports to guess their sales, like $500,000 per shop annually. Then, I’d calculate market share potential for our client. Does that sound reasonable?

Interviewer: It’s a start. What about customer preferences—how would you factor those in?

Interviewee: Good point. I’d, uh, run a survey or something—ask people what they like, maybe flavors or price points. Like, do they want cheap coffee or fancy lattes? That’d help us tailor the offering. I think that’s key, right?

Interviewer: Yes, tailoring is important. Anything else you’d consider before wrapping up?

Interviewee: Uh, yeah, just quickly—regulations, like permits for opening a shop, and maybe sustainability, since people care about that now. Then I’d pull it all together into a recommendation. How’s that?

Interviewer: Solid approach! Thanks for walking me through it.
