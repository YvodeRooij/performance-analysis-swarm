**Interviewer:** Good morning! Thanks for joining us today. Let’s get started with the case. Imagine you’re a consultant, and a client has come to you for advice. They want to enter the coffee shop market in a mid-sized city. How would you approach helping them make this decision?

**Interviewee:** Good morning! Thanks for having me. Alright, so this is about entering the coffee shop market in a mid-sized city. My first step would be to analyze the market to understand if this is a viable opportunity for the client. I’d break it down into a few key areas. Can I take a moment to structure my thoughts?

**Interviewer:** Sure, go ahead.

**Interviewee:** Great. So, I’d start with **market demand**—how many people in this city drink coffee, and how often? That’ll give us a sense of the customer base. Then, I’d look at **competition**—who’s already in the market, and how saturated is it? Next, I’d consider the **supply side**, like where we’d source coffee beans and other materials, and the associated costs. **Location** is another big one—finding a spot with good foot traffic would be critical. I’d also think about **pricing**, to see how we’d position ourselves against competitors, and **marketing**, to attract customers. Finally, I’d tie it all together with some financial estimates to see if it’s profitable. Does that framework make sense as a starting point?

**Interviewer:** Yes, it’s a solid framework. Before we dive deeper, can you clarify what you mean by “mid-sized city”? Any assumptions you’re making there?

**Interviewee:** Good question. I was picturing a city with a population of maybe 100,000 to 300,000 people—big enough to have a decent customer base but not a huge metro area like New York or LA. Does that align with what you had in mind, or should I adjust?

**Interviewer:** That’s fine. Let’s say the city has about 200,000 people, with a mix of young professionals, students, and families. It’s a growing city with a lively downtown. How would you proceed?

**Interviewee:** Perfect, that gives me a clearer picture. With 200,000 people, I’d first estimate demand. I’d assume a portion of the population drinks coffee regularly. Maybe there’s some industry data—say, 60% of people drink coffee at least once a week. That’s 120,000 potential customers. But I’d need to refine that—how many buy from coffee shops versus making it at home? Let’s say half prefer coffee shops, so 60,000 people. Does that sound reasonable, or do we have more specific data?

**Interviewer:** Let’s go with your assumption for now—60% drink coffee weekly, and half of those buy from shops. What’s next?

**Interviewee:** Okay, so 60,000 coffee shop customers. Next, I’d analyze **competition**. I’d want to know how many coffee shops are already operating. Are there big chains like Starbucks, or mostly local players? Do we have any info on that?

**Interviewer:** Good question. Suppose there are 15 coffee shops in the city—three are national chains, and the rest are independent local spots.

**Interviewee:** Got it. So, 15 shops serving 60,000 customers means about 4,000 customers per shop on average, assuming even distribution—which probably isn’t the case since chains might dominate. I’d dig into their market share later. For now, it suggests the market isn’t oversaturated, but I’d need to assess their strengths. Chains might have brand loyalty and scale, while local shops could win on ambiance or community ties. Does that align with what you’re seeing?

**Interviewer:** Yes, that’s fair. The chains do have a strong presence, but a couple of local shops are popular for their unique vibe and local sourcing. Let’s focus on competition now. How would you assess it quantitatively?

**Interviewee:** Quantitatively, okay. I’d estimate the total market size in revenue terms. Let’s assume each coffee shop has annual revenue based on industry benchmarks—say, $500,000 per shop, which is reasonable for a mid-sized city. With 15 shops, that’s $7.5 million total market size. 

To break it down, if each customer spends $5 per visit and visits twice a week, that’s $10 per week, or $520 per year. For 60,000 customers, that’s $31 million annually, but that’s if every customer only buys from shops, which isn’t realistic since some brew at home. My $7.5 million estimate feels more conservative and aligns with 15 shops at $500,000 each. 

For our client, I’d calculate potential market share. If they capture 5% of a $7.5 million market, that’s $375,000 in revenue. But I’d adjust based on competition strength—chains might make it harder to grab share. Can I refine this with more data, like the chains’ revenue versus local shops?

**Interviewer:** Let’s say the three chains account for 50% of the market, so $3.75 million, and the 12 local shops split the rest, averaging $312,500 each. How does that change your thinking?

**Interviewee:** Alright, so the chains are dominant—$1.25 million each annually, versus $312,500 for local shops. That suggests chains have scale and loyalty, maybe prime locations. Our client could aim for the local segment’s average—say, $300,000 to $400,000 in revenue—but we’d need to differentiate. Maybe target a niche the chains overlook, like specialty coffee or a cozy vibe. I’d also consider market growth. Is the coffee market expanding here?

**Interviewer:** Good point. Assume it’s growing at 5% per year.

**Interviewee:** Nice, so a $7.5 million market today becomes $7.875 million next year. That growth supports a new entrant. Our client could aim for $400,000 in year one, growing with the market. But I’d need profit margins—say, 15% in this industry—so $400,000 revenue gives $60,000 profit. That’s tight with startup costs, so I’ll circle back to financials later. For now, competition looks tough but manageable with differentiation.

**Interviewer:** Fair assessment. Now, how would you factor in customer preferences?

**Interviewee:** Customer preferences are critical for tailoring the offering. I’d want to know what this city’s 60,000 coffee buyers like. Are they into espresso drinks, drip coffee, or trendy options like cold brew? Do they care about organic or fair-trade beans? Price sensitivity matters too—are they happy with $4 lattes, or do they want cheaper options?

To get this, I’d suggest a quick survey—maybe 200 people downtown—to ask about drink preferences, spending habits, and what they value: price, quality, or experience. Alternatively, we could analyze competitors’ menus. If local shops push artisanal coffee and do well, that’s a clue. Any insights on what’s popular here?

**Interviewer:** Suppose there’s a trend toward health-conscious choices—plant-based milks and organic coffee are gaining traction.

**Interviewee:** Perfect, that’s actionable. We could offer oat or almond milk options and source organic beans, maybe highlight fair-trade certification. That could appeal to young professionals and students who value sustainability. I’d test if they’ll pay a premium—say, $4.50 versus $4 for a latte—if we brand it as high-quality and eco-friendly. Preferences like these could set us apart from chains.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. What else would you consider before wrapping up?

**Interviewee:** A few more things. First, **location**. With a growing downtown and university nearby, I’d target high-traffic spots—near offices or campus. Rent might be $3,000 monthly, so $36,000 yearly, but I’d confirm availability and costs.

Second, **supply side**. Sourcing organic beans might cost more—say, $5 per pound versus $3 for regular—but aligns with preferences. Other costs like cups, milk, and equipment need budgeting too.

Third, **regulations**. We’d need permits—health inspections, business licenses—which could take time and money, maybe $5,000 upfront.

Fourth, **marketing**. I’d launch with social media ads targeting locals, a grand opening with free samples, and a loyalty program—spend $10,000 initially to build buzz.

Finally, **financials**. Startup costs—rent, equipment, renovations—might hit $200,000. Monthly operating costs—rent, staff, supplies—say, $20,000. With $400,000 revenue and 15% margin, $60,000 profit covers $20,000 monthly plus some cushion, but it takes 3-4 years to recoup the $200,000. I’d refine these numbers with real data.

**Interviewer:** Good rundown. So, what’s your final recommendation?

**Interviewee:** Based on this, the market looks promising—60,000 customers, $7.5 million size, 5% growth, and room to differentiate. Competition is stiff, especially from chains, but a niche like organic, health-focused coffee in a prime downtown spot could work.

I’d recommend the client **proceed**, but with a clear strategy: invest $200,000 upfront, target $400,000 revenue in year one by capturing 5% market share, and focus on plant-based options and sustainability to stand out. Keep costs tight—validate rent and supply prices—and launch with strong marketing. It’s viable if they execute well and hit that growth wave. What do you think?

**Interviewer:** Well-structured and thoughtful. Thanks for walking me through it!

**Interviewee:** My pleasure. Thanks for the case!
